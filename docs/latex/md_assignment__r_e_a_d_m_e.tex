This is software architecture for the control of the robot in the environment developed by \href{https://studentrobotics.org}{\texttt{ Student Robotics}} in R\+OS. The software will rely on the move\+\_\+base and gmapping packages for localizing the robot and plan the motion.

The architecture is able to get the user request, and let the robot execute one of the following behaviors (depending on the user’s input)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item autonomously reach a (x,y) coordinate inserted by the user
\item let the user drive the robot with the keyboard
\item let the user drive the robot assisting them to avoid collisions

In a terminal type the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo apt-\/get install ros-\/<your\_ros\_distro>-\/navigation}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo apt-\/get install ros-\/<your\_ros\_distro>-\/teleop-\/twist-\/keyboard}

Add the line {\ttfamily ‘source \mbox{[}ws\+\_\+path\mbox{]}/devel/setup.bash’} in your {\ttfamily .bashrc} file.

To run the simulation, open two different terminal and type\+:

To run the node for this project, open another terminal and type\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}

If G\+UI is present, the package displays the joint positions in a window as sliders.
\item {\ttfamily robot\+\_\+state\+\_\+publisher}\+: the package uses the U\+R\+DF specified by the parameter robot\+\_\+description and the joint positions from the topic joint\+\_\+states to calculate the forward kinematics of the robot and publish the results via {\ttfamily tf}.

This R\+OS node is contained in the {\ttfamily gmapping} package and provides laser-\/based S\+L\+AM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Using {\ttfamily slam\+\_\+gmapping}, you can create a 2-\/D occupancy grid map from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot. To use {\ttfamily slam\+\_\+gmapping}, you need a mobile robot that provides odometry data and is equipped with a horizontally-\/mounted, fixed, laser range-\/finder. The {\ttfamily slam\+\_\+gmapping} node will attempt to transform each incoming scan into the {\ttfamily odom (odometry) tf} frame.

The {\ttfamily slam\+\_\+gmapping} node takes in {\ttfamily sensor\+\_\+msgs/\+Laser\+Scan} messages and builds a map ({\ttfamily nav\+\_\+msgs/\+Occupancy\+Grid}). The map can be retrieved via a R\+OS topic or service.

The {\ttfamily move\+\_\+base} package provides an implementation of an action that, given a goal in the world, will attempt to reach it with a mobile base. Actions are services which are not executed atomically, and thus may also offer some additional tools, such as a continuous feedback and the possibility of cancel the request.

Although the project works quite well, I think some improvements could be made\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The user is asked to wait 30 seconds before setting a new goal. You could ask the user to set the next goal while waiting and implement an array in which to collect the goals so that they are reached sequentially.
\item A set of points representing the limit of the area in which the robot can move could be set, so that if unreachable positions are entered the user is informed immediately.
\item When a goal is set, the robot moves forward and determines the path to reach it. The vision range of the robot could be extended so that if the goal is behind the robot, the robot can turn around and reach the position. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
